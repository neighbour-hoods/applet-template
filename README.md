# applet-template
This repository is a template for creating nh-we applets. It is meant to be cloned and provide the basic repository structure and scripts for developing and testing your nh-we applets.

DISCLAIMER: Please note this is only a template that mostly provides repository structure and helpful npm scripts, you will still need to write your own zome functions, entry types, validation functions, and the relevant tests. To speed up this process you can try the [Holochain Scaffolding tool](https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding/) to get basic CRUD functionality and tests scenarios. However, you will still have to implement much of the logic of your application.

## getting started
1. set up your development environment by following the steps in [Environment Setup](#environment-setup), and if you are having issues with nix see [Without Nix](#without-nix)
1. familiarize yourself with the [repository structure](./STRUCTURE.md) and [reactive state management](./REACTIVE-STATE-MANAGEMENT.md) documents and the use of two important dependencies: [`@neighbourhoods/nh-we-applet`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neighbourhoods/nh-we-applet) & [`@neighbourhoods/sensemaker-lite-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neighbourhoods/sensemaker-lite-types)
1. Clone this repository & run `npm i`
1. add your zome code (copy/edit files under to `dna`, `tests` and `ui` folders)
1. replace all instances of `provider` to match your hApp zome name (including in file or directory names)
1. create your applet config and add it to both [`./ui/src/appletConfig.ts`](./ui/src/appletConfig.ts) & [`./we-applet/src/appletConfig.ts`](./we-applet/src/appletConfig.ts). See [Creating Applet Config](#applet-config)
1. build your front end store object (see `providerStore.ts`)
1. test your UI with `npm run start`
1. package your applet as a `.webhapp` file to be imported by nh-we with `npm run package`

## using the holochain scaffolding tool
If you want to use the scaffolding tool to generate your holochain code, you can easily replace the `dnas` directory in this repository with the `dnas` directory generated through the scaffolding tool. In the future we hope to have a smoother integration between the two, but for now the steps look like:
1. create a separate repo
2. inside that repo, run `hc scaffold example forum` (or more specific uses of the command)
3. copy the generated `dnas` folder and replace the `dnas` folder in this repository with that one.
4. replace the root level `Cargo.toml` with the one from the scaffolding tool.
5. you will still need to change references to `provider` to whatever you are calling your dnas.
## testing your applet in NH Launcher
once you are ready to test your applet in we, you will need to run nh-we in developer mode to upload the webhapp file. To do that:
1. git clone [`nh-launcher`](https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/nh-launcher)
1. git fetch and switch to the `develop` branch
1. follow steps in the [read me](https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/nh-launcher/tree/develop) (`nix develop`, `npm i`, `npm run start`) to get we running in dev mode (it should launch into the browser)
1. create a we group
    - ![create group button](./images/add-group.png)
1. create your user in the group
1. go to applet library
    - ![applet library button](./images/applet-library.png)
1. select `INSTALL APPLET FROM FILESYSTEM` button
    - ![install from file button](./images/install-from-filesystem.png)
1. navigate to you applet `.webhapp` file and click `install`
    - ![select applet file](./images/select-applet-file.png)

## Applet Config
The Applet Config is where the **Sensemaker compatible** social interactions of your applet are defined, you can specify:

- **Dimension**s and **Range**s: to define in what ways your users can assess (for example, react or rate) your applet resources (computed dimensions can only receive values from Methods)
- **ConfigResourceType**s: they allow you to map hApp entry-types to sensemaker resources that can receive assessments
- **ConfigMethod**s: they allow performing computations on top of existing __input_dimensions__ into an __output_dimension__, following a __program__ brick (find more about the supported bricks at [this link](https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/sensemaker-lite/blob/develop/docs/program_bricks.md)). 
- **ConfigThreshold**s: they define how a Cultural Context will filter resources to be shown
- **ConfigCulturalContext**s: these allow the SenseMaker to filter and order resources according to rules defined in Thresholds and ordered according to __order_by__.
- **AppletConfigInput**: this object holds together all defined configurations for your Applet.

In the future we are providing a visual Wizard to make the creationg of such config files easier.

## Environment Setup

1. Install the holochain dev environment (using nix): https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/ (see https://hackmd.io/BKCt3FckSiSDJ4aSJ1Ur6A for a more comprehensive guide, especially if you are used to using `nix-shell` and `default.nix`)
2. Enable Nix commands and Nix flakes for your use:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

3. Clone this repo and `cd` inside of it.
4. Enter the nix shell by running this in the root folder of the repository: 

```bash
nix develop
npm install
```

This will install all the needed dependencies in your local environment, including `holochain`, `hc` and `npm`.

Run all the other instructions in this README from inside this nix environment, otherwise **they won't work**.

### Without Nix
It is possible to work with these repos without nix, but you will need to install the needed cargo packages to your local system. Run the following commands:
```
cargo install holochain --version 0.1.0
cargo install lair_keystore --version 0.2.3
cargo install holochain_cli_launch --version 0.0.11
cargo install holochain_scaffolding_cli --version 0.1.6
```

make sure they are properly installed with:
```
holochain --version
lair-keystore --version
hc-launch --version
hc-scaffold --version
```
## Running the DNA tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Building the DNA

```bash
npm run build:happ
```

## Package

To package the web happ:

``` bash
npm run package
```

You'll have the `provider.webhapp` in `workdir`. This is what you should distribute so that the Neighbourhoods Launcher can install it.

You will also have its subcomponent `provider.happ` in the same folder`.
